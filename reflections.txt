1. skills that I have learnt are how to render a image on page using <img> tag, how to create a link using <a href> tag, to bold a text using<b> and to draw a line using <hr> tag.Also all tags are not paired tags.



2.Everything was easy.

3.nothing was very difficult except I didnâ€™t know how to draw line but now I know it using <hr>


4.problem solving stratergy was to see how elements are placed in the snapshot just go step by step refresh the page to get the idea that changes made in index.html are correct and I am approaching towards my goal to make the replica of the snapshot provided.
